The code illustrated in this repository's [website](https://biomath.github.io/MacedoLima_CurBiol2024/) is read-only. For modifiable files, download .Rmd files

Raw data were preprocessed using our MatLab and Python pipelines listed below.

The workflow for most datasets in this project was:

1. Raw data collection with MatLab (ePsych) and Intan/Synapse software

2. Data preprocessing with MatLab:
    - [Behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-behavior-analysis)
    - [EPhys + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-spikesortingKS2)
    - [Fiber photometry + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-fiberphotometry)

3. Data processing and plotting with Python:
    - [EPhys + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/Caraslab_EPhys_preprocessing_pipeline)
    - [Fiber photometry + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/Caraslab_FP_preprocessing_pipeline)

4. Data analysis and plotting with R pipeline (current repository)
